Skeleton code for implementing a C lexer in Python, to be completed as an
exercise.

Note that the lack of sum types (aka tagged unions) and pattern matching (and
arguably the dynamic typing generally) makes Python a less appropriate
choice for this than a language like Rust, Swift, Haskell or OCaml.

But those languages are a lot less well known, and I wanted to create a simple
exercise for anyone who wants to have a go themselves at creating a lexer, to
tie in with a talk I'm going to be giving on lexing at work.
